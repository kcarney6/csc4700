The Bahamas

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

I would want to be able to teleport. I would be able to go anywhere on earth whenever I want, and leave whenever I want. I could escape danger and go on vacations. I could also explore the universe and challenge the nature of space and time itself.
